# Shipment - Create Graph using Highcharts and gstatic

This app is my try at creating graphs inside rails applications.

Dependencies:
  gem 'haml'
  gem "erb2haml"
  gem 'gon'
  
 Disclaimer: Does not work without unblocked internet connection (needs to connect to gstatic and highcharts)
 
 Gem 'gon' is used to have variables in javascripts from the controller
 and rest was taken from gstatic/charts
